Conclusion:
If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The user’s music listening patterns reveal an average valence, indicating they enjoy both happy and sad songs. Therefore, I would conclude that the user belongs to the Blue mood group, seeking out music to express their emotions.
