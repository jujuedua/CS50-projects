# **speller**

This program is designed to check the spelling of words in a given text file using a preloaded dictionary. Your goal is to implement the fastest spell checker possible, prioritizing real-world execution time over theoretical asymptotic efficiency.

## Compilation and Execution

-To compile the program, use:

   ```bash
$ make speller
   ```

To run speller, specify a dictionary file and a text file:

   ```bash
$ ./speller dictionaries/large texts/grimm.txt
$ ./speller dictionaries/large texts/lalaland.txt
$ ./speller dictionaries/large texts/constitution.txt
   ```
