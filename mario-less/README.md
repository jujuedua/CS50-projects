# **mario-less**

   ```bash
./mario
   ```

-Enter a height value when prompted (1 to 8). The program will generate a right-aligned pyramid of that height.

## Example Output

   ```bash
$ ./mario
Height: 8
          #
         ##
        ###
       ####
      #####
     ######
    #######
########

$ ./mario
Height: -3
Height: 3
     #
    ##
###
   ```
-If entred a negative number or a number that's not between 1 and 8 it will repeat it self until a valid answer.
